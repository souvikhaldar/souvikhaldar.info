## Introduction 
Recently, I got interested into learning the functional paradigm of programming because of many factors with the concept of immutability and minimalistic approach of programming being a few. Also, one of the biggest motivation was the fact that, **I want to learn at least one programming language in all the major programming paradigms**. I know Python which follows *Object Oriented Programming* and is also a scripting language, I know Golang which follows the *Interface based programming*,now I want to learn clojure because it follows the *Functional programming paradigm* and since it has access to most of the Java functionalities hence there a lot of battle tested functions to exploit as well.  
I believe learning by doing is the best way to internalize a new stuff.So, let's start building a project. Here, I would be building a URL shortening service for the same purpose.

## Steps

i) Create the project using leiningen `lein new app web-dev-clojure`  
ii) Open `emacs` then open this project `C-x C-f` navigate to the the core.clf inside `src`  
iii) Run the REPL using `Cider` `M-x RET cider-jack-in`  

## Project crux
Code of this project can be found [here](https://github.com/souvikhaldar/Redirector).   
I've create this [presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1P9GChVagzfivjWVNd9wBMfg9g9hi-rox93F4IYT10Rk/edit#slide=id.p) in which I would explain how to build a *URL Shortening Service* in Clojure and hence teaches the basics of Web-Development in Clojure.  

Follow this [video demonstration](https://youtu.be/IFA7gmiVa8E) of the above service and explanation of the background concepts.
