# Why these two, together? 
Clojure, a dialect of Lisp, is best suited to be a programmed in the legendary Emacs editor, which also happens to be programmed in Lisp. Coincidence? I think not!  
So, here I'm basically going to log my journey as I start learning the Clojure programming language in the Emacs editor. So this blog is going to witness Souvik Haldar learning two things at once :D  

# Basics steps for beginning a CLojure project 
Prerequisites:-
i) Install [Leiningen](https://leiningen.org/).  
ii) Create the project using `lein new app project_euler` (Since we are going to solve euler's problems for learning)  
iii) Open emacs
iv) `C-x C-f` (then locate the `core.clj` file inside `project_euler` directory)
