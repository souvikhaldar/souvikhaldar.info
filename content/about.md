## Profile

 I'm a Backend Developer by profession and mostly use Golang and Python to interact with computers. I like to read books/articles of various genres (little biased towards technical ones), socialize/hangout with friends and new people; and love to build and learn new things. I mostly write about things I'm learning, here or on [Medium](https://medium.com/@souvikhaldar) mostly to make it a point to visit later on, which others too might find helpful.
