# How I'm implementing the concepts of Getting Things Done 
Steps:  
1)  I'm using Todoist as first line of defence for any ideas or task that comes to my hand.    
2)  Then if the task takes less than 5 minutes to get done, I do it right away, otherwise it goes to next step.   
3)  Now if the task needs to be done on a specific date, then I assign it the date on the task itself.  
4)  But if the task might take time and it can be divided into smaller sub-problems, I create a project out of it and add it to Trello.
