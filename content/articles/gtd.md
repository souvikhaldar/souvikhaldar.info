# How I'm implementing the concepts of Getting Things Done 
## Steps:  
1)  I'm using Todoist as first line of defence for any ideas or task that comes to my hand.    
2)  Then if the task takes less than 5 minutes to get done, I do it right away, otherwise I will add it to *Inbox* in Todoist.   
3)  Now if the task needs to be done on a specific date, then I assign it the date on the task itself in Todoist.  
4)  But if the task might take time, it can be divided into smaller sub-problems, etc I create a project out of it or add to an existing project (a project called *Life* is always there) in Trello.  

### Now it is very normal to miss a few tasks, hence once in week I review all the tasks and reschedule if the need be.
