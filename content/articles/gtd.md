# How I'm implementing the concepts of Getting Things Done 
*Getting Things Done* is an excellent book on task management written by *David Allen*. As Wikipedia says:  
>The GTD method rests on the idea of moving planned tasks and projects out of the mind by recording them externally and then breaking them into actionable work items.   

This [video](https://youtu.be/gCswMsONkwY) summaries the GTD method elegantly.  
People implement this method in several ways, some use hand written journals, some use *org-mode* of emacs, etc. I tried to do it with [Todoist](https://todoist.com/) and [Trello](https://trello.com/).   
## Steps:  
1)  I'm using Todoist as first line of defence for any ideas or task that comes to my hand.    
2)  Then if the task takes less than 5 minutes to get done, I do it right away, otherwise I will add it to *Inbox* in Todoist.   
3)  Now if the task needs to be done on a specific date, then I assign it the date on the task itself in Todoist.  
4)  But if the task might take time, it can be divided into smaller sub-problems, etc I create a project out of it or add to an existing project (a project called *Life* is always there) in Trello.  

**Now it is very normal to miss a few tasks, hence once in week I review all the tasks and reschedule if the need be.** 
I do this typically on Saturday evening, so that I can put in extra efforts on Sunday to get the flow back on track.
