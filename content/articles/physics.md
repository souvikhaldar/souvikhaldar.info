*Change is a must. Once in a while we might feel our present condition shall last till death, but that's very untrue. Life never remains in static equilibrium, rather a continuum of meta stable equilibrium phases. Life like bob keeps oscillating between the two extremities of sorrow and happiness. Neither pain lasts for eternity nor do joy. Keeping in mind this very fact we must keep treading on the path to our goal. These changes make us, shape us to be the person which we are destined to be. We may deteriorate or we may ameliorate, but the end point is something which has already been written by Him. But, in this journey called life, having felt the two extremum of emotions, we must, hence, try to adapt to the changes like water, which, irrespective of the vessel in which it is kept, fills it up to it's destined height.*
