The following is the content on the preface for a yearbook that I wrote while at college.  
*Walking down the memory lane at some point in our lives, this memorabilia is unequivocal to induce the feeling of reminiscence. The nostalgia of the journey that began with the fear of knowing none to the fear of knowing all. Woven with the threads of memories, the accoutre hence forged will certainly be a lifelong companion. These are the memories that shall always remain fresh in the hearts and to ascertain the same we have compiled this album named  "Meri Yaadein". This album will make your moments of Deja Vu worth the while. So turn on the pages to strike a chord with Bryan Adams and sing along "Those were the best days of my life!"*
